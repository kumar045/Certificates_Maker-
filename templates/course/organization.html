             stored in ./certificate-maker/images/ or (b) be referenced with
             an absolute path. This ensures the path is correct even with the
             intermediary HTML files are made and stored, which are stored here
             by default:

               ./certificate-maker/certificates/intermediaries/TEMPLATE_NAME

             Also note that the signature image below is a PNG with transparent
             background. A real, scanned signature may end up as a JPG...
             If it does, make sure the image background color matches the
             HTML document's body background color!

      <!-- Note how we have to reference ID # and Issue Date differently than
           values like Name. That's because variable names can't include a space,
           which Issue Date does, or any special characters, which ID # does.

           If a variable name includes a space or special character, you can
           reference it like h["COLUMN HEADER NAME"] below.

           You can learn more about variable names *and* some special features
           the Nunjucks templating engine gives you (thanks, Nunjucks!):
